# PersonalityInsight
It basically compares two different personalities based on the basis of their twitter tweets.

The name of this application is PersonalityInsight.

The application does the following:

    Accepts two Twitter usernames as variables
    Retrieves the last 200 Tweets from each Twitter username
    Sends the text of the 200 Tweets to the Personality Insights (PI) API (covered in more detail later in this course) to gain insights on the       two users
    Compares the users to one another
    Displays the results of the comparison

The final results displayed will be the top 5 traits shared between the two Twitter users (for example: you and a celebrity of your choice).

The results are displayed in the following format:

Matched Personality Trait -> Probability of your profile exhibiting given trait -> Probability of Celebrity's profile exhibiting given trait.
